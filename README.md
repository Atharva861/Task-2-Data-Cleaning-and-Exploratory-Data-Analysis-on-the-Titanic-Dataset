# Task-2-Data-Cleaning-and-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-the-Titanic-Dataset

In this task, data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) were performed on the Titanic dataset obtained from the Kaggle competition. The dataset was preprocessed by handling missing values and removing irrelevant features. Relationships between variables such as passenger class, gender, age, and survival status were analyzed. Visualizations including count plots, histograms, violin plots, and heatmaps were generated to identify patterns and trends, and to provide insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival during the Titanic disaster.

### What is a Decision Tree Classifier?
A Decision Tree Classifier is a machine learning algorithm used to predict outcomes by learning simple rules from the data.

### Why Use It for Titanic?
The dataset has clear decision rules (e.g., females and first-class passengers were more likely to survive).
Decision Trees are easy to understand and visualize.
They can handle both numerical and categorical data.
