# Task-2-Data-Cleaning-and-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-the-Titanic-Dataset

In this task, data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) were performed on the Titanic dataset obtained from the Kaggle competition. The dataset was preprocessed by handling missing values and removing irrelevant features. Relationships between variables such as passenger class, gender, age, and survival status were analyzed. Visualizations including count plots, histograms, violin plots, and heatmaps were generated to identify patterns and trends, and to provide insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival during the Titanic disaster.

## Important Insights from the Titanic Dataset:
#### -Gender Played a Major Role in Survival:
A significantly higher percentage of females survived compared to males.
This reflects the "women and children first" evacuation policy.

#### -Passenger Class Affected Survival Rate:
Passengers in 1st class had a much higher chance of survival than those in 2nd or 3rd class.
3rd class passengers were the most affected.

#### -Younger Passengers Were More Likely to Survive:
Children, especially those under 10, had higher survival rates.
Elderly passengers had a lower chance of survival.

#### -Fare Paid Was Positively Correlated with Survival:
Passengers who paid higher fares (likely in 1st class) had better survival chances.

#### -Embarkation Point Had a Small Effect:
Passengers who boarded at Cherbourg (C) had a slightly higher survival rate than those from Southampton or Queenstown.

#### -Family Size Had Mixed Impact:
Traveling with 1â€“2 family members was slightly beneficial.
Large families (more than 3 members) had lower survival rates.
